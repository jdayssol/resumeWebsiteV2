        <p>
            <br />Joseph is a very hard-working person who can tackle any problem with ease. He is able to adapt to new
            technologies in a fast way. His interest in AI topics let him stay always on top of the newest movements in
            the market. But
            what makes him stand out is his willingness to help others. I am glad to have worked with him and have no
            hesitation
            recommending him to potential employers.

        <p><br />Joseph is a high-level java backend developer; I had the opportunities to receive
            advice from him in a java backend application, and he guided me through the best practices
            for implementing test unit and java architecture. He is always looking for improvements and
            searching for opportunities to share his knowledge with others.
            <br />Joseph is also transparent and trustable; that makes him a good match for work
            together.
