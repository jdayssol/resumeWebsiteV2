            <br />I've worked together with Joseph on a small project.
            He onboarded me very well on this project which mixed many different technologies (google
            cloud, firebase and Angular cli).
            He explained the interconnections very well showing a high understanding of the technologies
            used.

        <p><br />Joseph is a high-level java backend developer; I had the opportunities to receive
            advice from him in a java backend application, and he guided me through the best practices
            for implementing test unit and java architecture. He is always looking for improvements and
            searching for opportunities to share his knowledge with others.
            <br />Joseph is also transparent and trustable; that makes him a good match for work
            together.
