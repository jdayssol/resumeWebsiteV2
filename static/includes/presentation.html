            <p>
                With bachelor and master degrees in Computer Systems, I have accumulated more than 20 years
                of
                development experience (Java, JavaScript, C#. See complete technologie stack at end of this page). In
                2010 he completed
                further
                studies in management, which gives me a great deal of extra value due to his good business
                understanding.
                After that I worked in an agile sub-team of 5 developers responsible for building software
                in the
                insurance and risk management industries. I moved in 2020 in Hamburg and worked in two startup using the
                latest technologies and I am actually proud to work at News Aktuell GmbH since Aug. 2020.</p>
